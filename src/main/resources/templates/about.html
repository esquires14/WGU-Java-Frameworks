    <hr>
    <p>
        Bits &amp; Bytes Custom PC Shop specializes in building custom desktop computers
        for gamers, content creators, and professionals. We hand-pick every CPU, GPU,
        RAM kit, and storage drive that goes into our builds.

    <p>
        This inventory application helps us track individual PC components and prebuilt
        systems so we can keep our shelves stocked and our build queue moving.
